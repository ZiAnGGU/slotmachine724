# Slot Machine 
It is a clasic casino game "Slot Machine". I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. Also I've added some emojis to make game interesting.
You can play the game here ~ <a href="https://zianggu.github.io/slotmachine724/"> (Hope you like it)

## Next Steps -
As you can see, this is the first game I have written from scratch without any prior coding experience, and it will also serve as a starting point. The next step will be to enhance my understanding of pseudocode from various functions, and based on that understanding, incorporate it into this game or other games.
